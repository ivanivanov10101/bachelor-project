This is a repository hosting code for my BSc Computer Science Project.

It contains an ASYNC and SYNC implementations for HTTP GET requests and a multi-file JSON to CSV converter.

## Instructions:
Simply run the async_alternate.py with a .csv that contains a single column with every row being a website.

The script will do a HTTP 'GET' request to the API and awat a .json file which will be appended to a .csv file.

The csv file is stored in the /csv folder.

The data is then managed by CSV.ipynb
