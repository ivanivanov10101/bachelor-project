This is a repository hosting code for my BSc Computer Science Project.

It contains an ASYNC and SYNC implementations for HTTP GET requests and a JSON to CSV converter for many files.

## Instructions:
Simply run the async.py with a .csv that contains a single column with every row being a website.
Then run the json_to_csv.py to flatten and append every json file in the /json directory to a new .csv.
